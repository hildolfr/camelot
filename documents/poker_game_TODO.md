# Poker Game Implementation Discrepancies & TODO

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES (2025-06-13)

### 1. **Hand Evaluation at Showdown** ✅
**Fixed**: Implemented complete hand evaluation system
- Created `hand_evaluator.py` module with full 7→5 card evaluation
- Supports all hand types (Royal Flush → High Card)
- Proper tie-breaking with kickers
- Multi-way pot splitting with ties
- Integrated into `_resolve_showdown()` method
- All tests passing

### 2. **Player Count Validation** ✅
**Fixed**: Added validation for 2-10 player limit
- Validation added in `PokerGame.__init__` after player creation
- Raises `ValueError` if player count is outside 2-10 range

### 3. **Dealer.evaluate_hand()** ℹ️
**Status**: Not fixed but not needed
- The placeholder in `dealer.py` is not used by the game
- All evaluation is handled directly in `poker_game.py` using our new evaluator

## Remaining Issues ⚠️

### 4. **Side Pot Edge Cases**
**Issue**: Complex side pot logic in `_calculate_pots()` may not handle all scenarios
**Concerns**:
- Multi-way all-ins with different stack sizes
- Proper pot eligibility tracking
- Clear documentation of pot distribution
**Status**: Not critical - current implementation works for most cases

## Summary

The poker game now has proper hand evaluation and winner determination! The critical issues have been resolved:

1. ✅ **Hand Evaluation**: Full implementation with all hand types and proper ranking
2. ✅ **Winner Determination**: Correct pot distribution including split pots
3. ✅ **Player Validation**: Enforces 2-10 player limit
4. ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite verifying all hand types

The game is now fully functional and determines winners correctly at showdown.

## Technical Details

### Hand Evaluator Module (`src/camelot/core/hand_evaluator.py`)
- Evaluates 7 cards to find best 5-card hand
- Supports all 10 hand types (Royal Flush → High Card)
- Proper tie-breaking with kickers
- Handles special cases (wheel straight, 10 vs T)

### Integration
- `_resolve_showdown()` now uses `get_winning_players()` for each pot
- Winners are logged with their hand names
- Split pots are handled correctly
- Animation system updated to show hand names

### Testing
- Test suite at `src/camelot/tests/test_hand_evaluator.py`
- Tests all hand types, winner determination, and edge cases
- All tests passing
