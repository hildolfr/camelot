```python
ROYAL_FLUSH = 10      # A-K-Q-J-10 same suit
STRAIGHT_FLUSH = 9    # 5 sequential same suit
FOUR_OF_A_KIND = 8    # 4 of same rank
FULL_HOUSE = 7        # 3 of a kind + pair
FLUSH = 6             # 5 same suit
STRAIGHT = 5          # 5 sequential
THREE_OF_A_KIND = 4   # 3 of same rank
TWO_PAIR = 3          # 2 pairs
ONE_PAIR = 2          # 1 pair
HIGH_CARD = 1         # None of above
```

### Example Showdown Output
```

FlushPlayer (A‚ô• 9‚ô•): Flush (Ace high)
